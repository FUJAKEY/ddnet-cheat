- AutoVerify
- Player Indicator
- Ping Circle next to names
- Nameplates in spec ig?
- Render Cursor in Spec - with an opacity config

-Parts of Chillerbot-
- War List - its almost like the normal chillerbot except that the commands are also in the console (I'm too dumb to make silent chat commands, chillervot please would love that feauture or maybe i missed it while copying- i mean proffesionally writting code myself ofc)
