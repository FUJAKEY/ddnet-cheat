Foxs turn on copying files from other clients and making a *semi* All In One client, which will be called... Aiodob

Will upload my stuff in a few days, gotta wait till i get my new router :p 
literally got no internet at all on my pc for a few days

-Client will include-

Parts of TaterClient 
- Bind Wheel
- Skin Profiles
- AutoVerify
- Player Indicator
- Ping Circle next to names
- Nameplates in spec ig?
- Render Cursor in Spec - with an opacity config

-Parts of Chillerbot-
- War List - its almost like the normal chillerbot except that the commands are also in the console (I'm too dumb to make silent chat commands, chillervot please would love that feauture or maybe i missed it while copying- i mean proffesionally writting code myself ofc)
- Skin Stealer
- Camp - might be bannale I have no clue tbh
- Finish Rename
- Auto reply - When alt tabbed


To Do:
Add every setting to the Aiodob Menu
Add a few near little features i found in a small client c:
try to get silent commands to work (literally got no coding experience this is the first thing i ever done and succesfully too :D)
